Welcome to our (because it's open source) funny js minification/compression project.

Running
-------

Before running minifyme, I recommend using jslint. Try https://github.com/reid/node-jslint

    jslint myfile.js #fix your errors and go ahead
    ./minifyme myfile.js


Performance
-----------

Not yet a requirement for this project. It's just for fun!
